# Mactracker-online

## What is Mactracker Online?
It's Mactracker redesigned with a search function only directly in your Browser!

## But i don't wanna use Internet to access MT-Online!
Not my problem :)
Nah, jk. Under "Relases" you can find an executable app for Mac, and Windows

## But what's the Difference between Ian Page's Mactracker and yours?
1.) It's accessible on *every* OS with a Browser installed. Not just macOS and iOS.
2.) It has a better looking UI, is OpenSource, etc.

## So Wen ETA?
Now :) You can access it at https://mactracker.online
